This project aims to detect fraudulent insurance claims using machine learning algorithms. It provides a user-friendly interface via Streamlit, where users can upload a dataset or use sample data for fraud detection analysis. The system performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization. Users can choose between two machine learning models—Logistic Regression and Random Forest—for classification.
